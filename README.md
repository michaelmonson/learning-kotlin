# learning-kotlin

The purpose of this project is to help me learn Kotlin through example.
I find it very close to Java Syntax, but written to reduce code complexity, 
in a way that Java would probably have been written as a modern high-level language.

Kotlin Classes are arranged under packages as categories of concepts and learning.
Simply execute the class directly.  Until I write more complex examples that span
multiple files, each class should be self-contained... at least at first!

### About Kotlin
Kotlin is a general-purpose, open-source programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming features. It's statically typed and interoperable with Java, Android, and the Java virtual machine (JVM). Kotlin is often used in conjunction with Java, and it's widely used to develop Android applications, server-side applications, and multiplatform mobile development. 
Kotlin has several advantages, including: 

### Similar concepts
Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala. 

### Interoperability
Kotlin compiles to the same byte code as Java, making it easy to migrate Java applications to Kotlin. Kotlin also allows you to use Java libraries in Kotlin projects. 

### Safety
Kotlin features null safety and eliminates null pointer exception errors. It makes it easy to work with null values using the "?" operator, which helps avoid null reference errors that can cause crashes in other programming languages. 

### Concise syntax
Kotlin has a more concise syntax than Java. 

### Additional Information
Kotlin was developed by JetBrains and first released in 2016. In 2019, Google named Kotlin the preferred language for Android development over Java. More than 60% of professional Android developers use Kotlin. It is quickly becoming a contendor for programming, and has been named a first-class language.
